The Sims 4 Collaborates with Overwolf 
to Make User-Generated Content Accessible to Players

Platform empowers creators and players to build, share and play
For years, The Sims™ community has been expanded 
by modders and custom content creators. 

We are taking a big step forward in recognizing 
and celebrating modder contributions. 
For the first time in our history, 
we’ll have a destination for The Sims 4 players 
to download mods and user-generated content. 

This will come to life through our new collaboration 
with Overwolf, on their mod manager and discovery 
platform for user-generated content, CurseForge.
