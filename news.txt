We’ve welcomed millions of players to The Sims and watched in awe as 
they’ve unleashed their imaginations, discovered and connected with 
ideas,experiences and versions of themselves, both in-game and real life. 

The Sims has always been about celebrating new ways to play and offers 
so many possibilities for discovery, we're excited to continue to welcome 
in more players than ever.
